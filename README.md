# VAE-CNN-RNN-extracting-parameter

A program using PyTorch to implement a variational autoencoder (VAE) to extract system parameters from a pool of chaotic times series. Based on this [reportsitory](https://github.com/peterparity/PDE-VAE-pytorch).

Running configurations are setted in the .json files in the folder input_files.

Run and tested on Python 3.8.5 and PyTorch 1.13.1.
